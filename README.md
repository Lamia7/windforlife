# WindForLife

## Context

FieldBox.ai just got selected in the final round for a new business opportunity: refactoring the
frontend for the application of WindForLife, a non-profit organization providing real-time wind
data around the world.

Our CEO is ecstatic, as a hobbyist kitesurfer, he actually uses their application everyday and
clearly wants us to win the contract. In order to showcase the company’s skills, he kindly asks
the engineering team if they could prepare a quick POC so he can demonstrate to WindForLife
that FieldBox.ai is the perfect partner for them.

The demo is just a couple hours away... Never shy for a fun challenge, you quickly volunteer to
design and build a first prototype for this interface. “Let’s make the CEO’s dream come true !”,
you think to yourself, before frantically starting typing on your keyboard.

## Features implemented:

- The home page shows an interactive map with all anemometers.
- Clicking on an anemometer opens a detailed view.
- Anemometer’s detailed view:
- Display basic information and statistics.
- Display a chart showing the evolution of wind speeds over time for the given
  readings.
